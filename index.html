			<h2>Sport Car</h2>
			<p class="quote">What is a sports car? A car may be a sporting automobile without 
			without being a sports car.</p>
			<p class="text">A sports car is a car designed with an emphasis on dynamic performance, such as handling, 
			acceleration, top speed, or thrill of driving. Sports cars originated in Europe in the early 1900s and are currently produced by many manufacturers around the world.</p>
			<p class="text">Definitions of sports cars often relate to how the car design is optimised for dynamic performance, without any specific minimum requirements; both a Triumph Spitfire and Ferrari 488 Pista can be considered sports cars, despite vastly different levels of performance. Broader definitions of sports cars include cars "in which performance takes precedence over carrying capacity", or that emphasise the "thrill of driving"or are marketed "using the excitement of speed and the glamour of the (race)track"However, other people have more specific definitions, such as "must be a two-seater or a 2+2 seater" or a car with two seats only.</p>

			<h2>Seating Layout</h2>
			<p class="quote">Traditional sports cars were typically two-seat roadsters.</p>
			<p class="text">Traditionally, the most common layout for sports cars was a roadster (a two-seat car without a fixed roof),however there are also several examples of early sports cars with four seats.Sports cars are not usually intended to regularly transport more than two adult occupants, so most modern sports cars are usually two-seat layout or 2+2 layout (two smaller rear seats for children or occasional adult use). Larger cars with more spacious rear-seat accommodation are usually considered sports sedans rather than sports cars.
            The 1993-1998 McLaren F1 is notable for using a three-seat layout, where the front row consists of a centrally-located driver's seat.</p>
			<p class="text">The location of the engine and driven wheels significantly influence the handling characteristics of a car and are therefore important in the design of a sports car. Traditionally, most sports cars have used rear-wheel drive with the engine either located at the front of the car (FR layout) or in the middle of the car (MR layout). Examples of FR layout sports cars are the Caterham 7, Mazda MX-5, and the Dodge Viper. Examples of MR layout sports cars are the Ferrari 488, Ford GT and Toyota MR2.To avoid a front-heavy weight distribution, many FR layout sports cars are designed so that the engine is located further back in the engine bay, as close to the firewall as possible.
            Since the 1990s, all-wheel drive has become more common in sports cars. All-wheel drive offers better acceleration and favorable handling characteristics (especially in slippery conditions), but is often heavier and more mechanically complex than traditional layouts. Examples of all-wheel drive sports cars are the Lamborghini Huracan, Bugatti Veyron, and Nissan GT-R.</p>
